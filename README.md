## Installation:
Our application required the use of node, mysql, express and express-handlebars.
## Instructions:
Our app is pretty simple, you are presented with a list of burgers that the user still wants to try, and one with burgers they have already tried. They have the option of "checking off" burgers that were on the want list, or putting tried burgers back on if they want a second attempt.
